 * Role-gated lifecycle transition rules (SRS FR-2.4, FR-2.5, FR-2.7).
 * Screening-gate evaluation for the screened transition happens
 * separately (server/services/screening.ts) — this only decides whether
 * the requester's role may attempt the move at all.
 *
 * guided_to_apply and submitted are both system-only forward transitions
 * now — the Candidate Information Form is screened *before* an account
 * exists, so "guided to apply" really means "has claimed their invite and
 * created an account" (fired from /api/auth/register) and "submitted"
 * means "required documents are uploaded" (fired from /api/upload), not
 * something staff manually advance to.
